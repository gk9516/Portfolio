											<h2>College Life</h2>
											<h3></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											College life is known as one of the most memorable years of oneâ€™s life. 
											It is entirely different from school life. 
											College life exposes us to new experiences and things that we were not familiar with earlier.
											For some people, college life means enjoying life to the fullest and partying hard. 
											While for others, it is time to get serious about their career and study thoroughly for a brighter future.
										</p>
										<p>		
											Nonetheless, college life remains a memorable time for all of us. 
											Not everyone is lucky enough to experience college life. 
											People do not get the chance to go to college due to various reasons.
											Sometimes they do not have a strong financial background to do so while other times they have other responsibilities to fulfill.
											The ones who have had a college life always wish to turn back time to live it all once again.
										</p>
										<p>
											The Transition from School Life to College Life
											College life is a big transition from school life. 
											We go through a lot of changes when we enter college. 
											Our schools were a safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. 
											The transition to college is so sudden that you are no longer protected by your teachers and friends of your school time.
										</p>
										<p>
											College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you. 
											You are now in a place full of unfamiliar faces where you need to mingle in. 
											It teaches us to socialize and form opinions of our own. 
											In college, students learn their free will and they go on to become more confident and composed.
										</p>
										<p>
											In school life, we were always dependant on our friends or teachers. 
											College life teaches us to be independent. 
											It makes us stronger and teaches us to fight our own battles. 
											It also makes us serious about our careers.
											We make decisions that will affect our future all by ourselves, as in school life our parents did it for us.
										</p>
										<p>
											Additionally, in schools, we viewed our teachers as our mentors and sometimes even parents. 
											We respected them and kept a distance. 
											However, in college life, the teacher-student relationship becomes a bit informal. 
											They become more or less like our friends and we share our troubles and happiness with them as we did with our friends.
