											<h2>Aim in my Life</h2>
											<h3></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The aim in life is really important because an aimless person is like a rudderless ship in the sea and does not know the direction of their destination. 
											Likewise, if we also dont have an aim in our life, we wont know where to reach. 
											Thus to achieve it one has to overcome many obstacles and setbacks from time to time. 
											I always wanted to be a professor and now my family is inspiring me to become a professor too. 
											My parents are really supportive and they respect my decision. 
											I have seen lots of my friends want to become a professor, and some of them want to pursue MBA. 
											There are a lot of aims and goals available that students can choose in their life. 
											Right now in this world, the top trending professions are Doctor, Teacher, Programmer, Designer, Architect, Marketer, Supervisor, Manager, Engineer, etc. 
											Maybe you have something unique in you and you want to pursue that. 
											So different people adopt different aims according to their inclination or taste or perception about life. 
											My teachers are really helpful and are always guiding and helping with my future plans.</p> 
										<p>
											They have always inspired me to do better and work harder. 
											I was once explaining some doubts to my classmates and I realized that I really like explaining and teaching. 
											Later, I experienced teaching while doing an internship with an NGO. 
											I went to a slum and taught kids there. 
											I felt a different kind of satisfaction after teaching them. 
											At that time I realized that I have never felt happier than this and decided to become a professor. 
											I am the one who enjoys exploring new places and getting to know new cultures, languages, and cuisines, then working as a professor offers many chances for me to develop those interests.
